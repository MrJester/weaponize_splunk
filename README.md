# Weaponizing Splunk: Using Blue Team Tools for Evil

This is a collection of the developed apps and the presentation slides.

Splunk is a log aggregation and correlation tool that is normally used for
defensive analysis and infrastructure management. What if Attackers could use
this same tool against the blue team? Companies deploy security products with no
real purpose other than checking a box. While these tools can be used for good
they can also turn against the organization and become their worst nightmare.
During this presentation, I will discuss creative uses of Splunk that
penetration testers and red teamers can use to gain more access and move
laterally within an organization.
